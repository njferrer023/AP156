### Questions:
#### How should the code be changed if I want the Greek symbol \pi instead?
# Just change Pi to $\pi$:
# plt.xticks([0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1], ["0", "$\pi$/4", "$\pi$/2", "3$\pi$/4", "$\pi$"])
# plt.yticks([0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10], ["0", "2$\pi$", "4$\pi$", "6$\pi$", "8$\pi$", "10$\pi$"])

###### What other plot options for plt.xlabel are available?
# 

#### What would happen if plt.show() is not commented out? Try it.
# If plt.show() is not commented out, the output figures would appear one at a time. Otherwise, all of the figures appear simultaneously.



#### Double-check the expressions sinuspsi and phinorm
# These expressions are consistent with eq 1.2 and 1.5 respectively

#### Where is the zero reference point of phi?
# The zero reference point of phi is the vertical line

#### When phi/phi0 = 1, where is the bob?
# When phi/phi0 = 1, the bob is at its maximum angular displacement
